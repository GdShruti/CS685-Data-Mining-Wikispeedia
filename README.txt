Introduction
------------
	 Wikispeedia is an online human-computation game that has been used to collect details of human navigation paths on Wikipedia. In this game, a player needs to navigate and reach an article from some other unrelated article by clicking on the Wikipedia links. The report diagrams some analysis of the concepts used in this game and various ways to evaluate and use those analysis.

Requirements
------------
	The assignment has only few software requirements:
		* Python should be installed.
		* "pandas" library should be installed
		* "networkx" library should be installed

How to run
----------
	* Open a terminal and navigate to this folder. 
	* Run the assign2.sh script using following command:
		
			bash assign2.sh
	
	* This command would run the assign2.sh script, which contains the scripts specified in each question. Each script would run and output files would be generated. 
	* The output csv files generated by the scripts would be saved in folder named "csv-files".

Key Points
----------
	* The python scripts are saved in a folder named "python-scripts". 
	* Scripts specified in each question would be automatically called by assign2.sh.
	* The python codes are run using python command and not python3. 
	* A report named report.tex is included. It has the details of some analysis performed on the given data using different techniques.  
	* The compilation of report may produce some errors, but it gets compiled.
	* The execution of the assign.sh may take more than 20 minutes depending on the system configuration. Mainly the graph-components.sh 		  might take longer to finish is system configurations are low.
